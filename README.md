# wdi-project-4

##Intoduction

Hobbyist was made as my final project at General Assembly. This app was created for
serial hobbyist to find new hobbies and meet people with the same interest. I was
inspired by the android.com quiz which finds users a phone suitable for them.
Similarly Hobbyist uses a quiz in order to narrow down the hobbies from 60
hobbies to 1 hobby.
